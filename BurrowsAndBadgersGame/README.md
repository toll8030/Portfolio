### Burrows and Badgers
This was a personal project I made during the summer after my Freshman year of college. Relatively new to java I wanted to try my hand at a simple console RPG. I used the basic class-method structure I had been taught to create a hero class, a monster classs, and a sort of platform with a menu for the interface. Burrow.java is the main file used to execute the program.
